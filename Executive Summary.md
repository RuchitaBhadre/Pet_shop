The programming and construction of the Pet-Shop DApp project are based on the tutorials, pet shop, and elections. All of the tutorial's functions are utilized and replicated in the project; however, the pet shop template has additional functionality added. Once inside the pet store, the client/user can adopt and pay for the dog(s) of their choice. Additionally, users/clients can vote for their favorite dog on the side. Ether can also be donated to the shop and data from both the user and store are displayed on the webpage.

We used the pet shop seed DApp from the assignment and added following features:

1. A way of **donating** **ether** to the pet shop transferred from Web3Basics SendMeEther. The user can choose to donate to the pet shop by clicking on the Send Ether button in the navigation bar, it will take the user to another page where you can enter the amount you wish to donate and hit submit.

1. A way of **keeping track of user account** info. When the user launches the pet shop, a welcome message will be seen with the user’s address at the top.
1. A way of **keeping track of how many customers** have been served and **how many pets adopted**. On the left hand top corner a Pet Shop Status panel will be seen which will display the number of clients in the shop, the number of pets that have been adopted in total and the number of pets that the particular user has adopted. (**2 features**)
1. A way of **voting for the best pets** (or liking a pet) in the Petshop DApp transferred from Elections. Below the Pet Shop Status panel, there is a dropdown list box that lets the user choose their favorite pet and vote for it. In addition to that the user will see the total number of votes each pet has received.
